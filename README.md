## Abstract
The thesis deals with the application of methods from graph theory and their visualisation to the analysis of narration in television news.

Code has been created with to be used for the seminar paper and is not yet ready to be used on any machine. This means, that the code contains static but relativ addresses, that need to be adapted for certain tasks, not everything is modularized and the visualization is dependent on a 1920x1080 resolution monitor.
